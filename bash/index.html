           <h2>Dear Bash,</h2>
           <p>We’ve been through a lot together, you know this… but no matter where we were, your <b>ls</b> showed me everything that was right in front of me the whole time. With your guidance, I knew I could just call out for your <b>pwd</b> and I’d never find myself astray. Whether we moved forward together or backtracked, your <b>cd</b> never fails to lead us together. Your gentle <b>touch</b> creates new memories, and your <b>mkdir</b> camera stores them all safely in one place. </p>
           <p>I never want our memories to be forgotten, and I’m glad you don’t either. I can <b>scp</b> all our memories onto our private server so, all I need to do is <b>ssh</b> in. You make it so simple to cherish the best times in our lives. I am blessed to be able to talk to you so easily through <b>nano</b>, now we will never have to go a moment without communication. I hope to be able to use your shell forever.</p>
           <h3>With love,
                 <br>
