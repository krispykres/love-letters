           <h2>Dear GitHub,</h2>
           <p>Without you, I would live in constant anxiety, but with you around, I know that our history is safe no matter what. You and bash work so well together and make it so easy for me. With a simple <b>git remote add origin</b>, you two were tied and I knew this was something special. I love checking your <b>git status</b> because I know after a single <b>git add .</b> you will be all ready to go. My favorite part about being <b>git commit -m</b> to you is being able to write you messages all the time. I feel like I am always reminded how I felt last time I wrote a message. Whenever you need a little <b>git push</b>, I always am here and that always seals our bind stronger. Thank you for being there so safeguard our history, I will never forget all these special moments.</p>
           <h3>With love,
                 <br>
